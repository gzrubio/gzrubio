# 👋 Hi! I'm Gonzalo

```python
class SystemsThinker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "CTO @ bmetric"
        self.passion = "Founder @ Sotavento Labs"
        self.education = "Mathematics and Software Engineering"
        self.motto = "Don't be evil"
```

I connect systems, bridge domains, and ultimately ensure technology gets out of the way of the users
