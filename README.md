# Gonzalo Rubio-Casas

```python
class SystemsThinker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "CTO @ bmetric & Founder @ Sotavento Labs"
        self.motto = "Don't be evil"
```

I connect systems, bridge domains, and ultimately make sure technology gets out of the way of the final user!
Part architect, part mad scientist — I'm driven by understanding how things work and making them work together.
